## README

### Description:
This Python script utilizes the `cv2`, `mediapipe`, `math`, `ctypes`, `comtypes`, and `pycaw` libraries to control the system's audio volume using hand gestures detected through the webcam. It calculates the distance between two points on the hand to adjust the volume accordingly.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- ctypes (`ctypes`)
- comtypes (`comtypes`)
- pycaw (`pycaw`)

### Installation:
1. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Position your hand in front of the webcam.
3. Stretch your thumb and index finger apart to increase or decrease the volume.
4. The volume changes based on the distance between your thumb and index finger.

### Notes:
- Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning properly.
- Adjust the volume range in the script if needed.
- Press 'q' to exit the program.
